# Problem 1

## Load tidyverse and create the logical, character, and factor vectors within the dataframe

  - a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 8
  - a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor
    “levels”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──

``` r
set.seed(100)

hw1q1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = c(norm_samp > 0),
  vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H"),
  vec_fac = factor(c("low", "med", "high", "low", "med", "high", "low", "med"))
)
```

  - This creates a dataframe called hw1q1\_df comprised of a random
    sample of size 8 from a standard normal distribution (norm\_samp), a
    logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
    than 0 (vec\_logical), a character vector of length 8 (vec\_char),
    and a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different levels
    (vec\_fac).

## Try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(hw1q1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.1256937

``` r
mean(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.625

``` r
mean(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_fac)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

## What works and what doesn’t?

  - Only the first 2 variables have a mean value outputted. We cannot
    take the mean of a character or factor variable, so we get an error
    that the argument is not numeric or logical for the second two lines
    of
code.

## Apply as.numeric function to our logical, character, and factor vectors

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_fac))
```

  - When we apply the as.numeric function to our vectors, we get number
    values for our logical and factor variables, so we can take their
    means now. However, since the character vector does not connect to
    numbers, we cannot convert to numeric and are given the “NAs
    introduced by coercion” error.

## Converting vectors

  - convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result
    to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the
    result

<!-- end list -->

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_logical)) * pull(hw1q1_df, norm_samp)
```

    ## [1] 0.0000000 0.1315312 0.0000000 0.8867848 0.1169713 0.3186301 0.0000000
    ## [8] 0.7145327

``` r
as.factor(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_logical)) * pull(hw1q1_df, norm_samp)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_logical)),
    ## pull(hw1q1_df, : '*' not meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(hw1q1_df, vec_logical)))*pull(hw1q1_df, norm_samp)
```

    ## [1] -0.50219235  0.26306233 -0.07891709  1.77356962  0.23394254  0.63726018
    ## [7] -0.58179068  1.42906542

  - The first line of code converts our logical vector to numeric, and
    multiplies the random sample by the result. However, you cannot
    multiply a factor vector, so we get an error in the second line of
    code that the symbol \* is not meaningful for factor vectors. The
    third line of code converts the logical vector to a factor vector,
    then converts the result to numeric, and multiplies that result by
    the random sample.

# Problem 2

## Creating a dataframe that consists of

  - x: a random sample of size 500 from a standard Normal distribution
  - y: a random sample of size 500 from a standard Normal distribution
  - A logical vector indicating whether x + y \> 1
  - A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
  - A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector

<!-- end list -->

``` r
set.seed(100)

hw1q2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec_log = c(x + y > 1), 
  vec_num = as.numeric(vec_log),
  vec_fac = as.factor(vec_log)
)
```

  - This creates a dataframe called hw1q2\_df comprised of a random
    sample of size 500 from a standard normal distribution (x), a random
    sample of size 500 from a standard normal distribution (y), a
    logical vector indicating whether x + y \> 1 (vec\_log), a numeric
    vector created by coercing vec\_log (vec\_num), and a factor vector
    created by coercing vec\_log (vec\_fac).

## Inline code describing the data

There are 500 rows in the dataframe and 5 columns. The mean value of x
is -0.0376074, the median value of x is -0.0600876, and the standard
deviation of x is 1.0049216. The proportion of cases for which x + y \>
1 is
0.242

## Create scatterplots of logical, numeric, and factor vectors

``` r
ggplot(hw1q2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_log)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height = 6, width = 6)

ggplot(hw1q2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_num)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_bw2595_files/figure-gfm/Problem2_scatterplot-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(hw1q2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_fac)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_bw2595_files/figure-gfm/Problem2_scatterplot-3.png)<!-- -->

  - The first plot of y vs. x using the logical variable has two
    different colors for points. The red points indicate that the
    observation does not satisfy the statement that the sum of x and y
    is greater than 1, and the blue dots satisfy that condition.

  - The second plot of y vs. x using the numeric vector has a color
    scale, if we were to have points that were not either 0 or 1. Since
    we are converting the logical vector to numeric, we will only have 0
    or 1 values, so that is why we only see 2 distinct colors, rather
    than the gradient shown in the key.

  - The third plot of y vs. x using the factor vector is similar to the
    logical vector graph. The red points indicate that the observation
    does not satisfy the logical vector statement, while the blue ones
    show points that satisfy the condition that x + y \> 1.
